## Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types in Python

Objective: 
Introduce the concept of variables and explore different data types in Python, such as integers, strings, floats, and booleans.

### 1. Introduction to Variables
Variables are like containers that can store different types of data. They help us work with information in our programs.

###  2. Naming Variables
- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_), followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., 'myVar' and 'myvar' are different).
- Choose descriptive variable names for clarity.
Example:
```python
my_variable = 42
name = "Alice"
is_student = True
temperature = 25.5
```

### 3. Data Types in Python
Python supports various data types:
- Integer (int): Whole numbers (e.g., 42, -10)
- Float (float): Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)
- String (str): Text enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes (e.g., "Hello, Python!")
- Boolean (bool): True or False

### In-Class Examples (Additional)
Example 1: Integer Operation
```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Addition
sum_result = num1 + num2
print("Sum:", sum_result)

# Subtraction
difference_result = num1 - num2
print("Difference:", difference_result)

# Multiplication
product_result = num1 * num2
print("Product:", product_result)

# Division
quotient_result = num1 / num2
print("Quotient:", quotient_result)
```

Example 2: Float Operations
```python
pi = 3.14159
radius = 2.0

# Calculate the area of a circle
area = pi * (radius ** 2)
print("Circle Area:", area)
```

Example 3: String Operations
```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"

# Concatenate strings
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Full Name:", full_name)

# String Length
name_length = len(full_name)
print("Name Length:", name_length)
```

Example 4: Boolean Logic
```python
is_python_fun = True
is_learning = False

# Logical AND
both_conditions = is_python_fun and is_learning
print("Both Conditions:", both_conditions)

# Logical OR
either_condition = is_python_fun or is_learning
print("Either Condition:", either_condition)

# Logical NOT
not_python_fun = not is_python_fun
print("Not Python Fun:", not_python_fun)
```
### 4. Exercises
- Exercise 1: Create a variable `my_age` and assign your age to it as an integer.
- Exercise 2: Create a variable `favorite_number` and assign your favorite number as a float.
- Exercise 3: Create a variable 'greeting' and assign it a string with a friendly greeting.
- Exercise 4: Create a variable `is_happy` and assign it a boolean value representing whether you are happy today.
- Exercise 5: Calculate the sum of two integers and store the result in a variable `total`.
- Exercise 6: Concatenate two strings to form a full name and store it in a variable `full_name`.
- Exercise 7: Calculate the average of two float numbers and store the result in a variable 'average'.

### 5. Conclusion
In this lesson, you've learned about variables and different data types in Python. Variables are essential for storing and working with data in your programs. Understanding data types helps you manage and manipulate information effectively.

Continue practicing with variables and data types to become a proficient Python programmer. Enjoy your coding journey!
