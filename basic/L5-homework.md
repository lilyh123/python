## Homework 5: Lists and Tuples in Python

#### Part 1: Theory Questions
1. Define the following terms:
   - List
   - Tuple
   - Indexing
   - Mutability
   - Immutability

2. Explain the difference between lists

3. Describe how indexing works in lists and tuples. Provide examples to illustrate indexing in both data structures.

#### Part 2: Coding Problems
4. Problem 1: List Manipulation
   Write a Python program that demonstrates various operations on lists, including:
   - Creating a list of integers.
   - Appending new elements to the list.
   - Removing elements from the list.
   - Accessing and modifying elements at specific indices.
   - Printing the final list.

5. Problem 2: Tuple Operations
   Write a Python program that showcases the use of tuples by performing the following operations:
   - Creating a tuple of strings.
   - Accessing elements using indexing.
   - Attempting to modify an element (which should result in an error due to immutability).
   - Concatenating two tuples.
   - Printing the final tuples.

6. Problem 3: List vs. Tuple
   Write a short essay comparing and contrasting lists and tuples in Python. Discuss their similarities, differences, and situations where one might be preferred over the other.

Submission Guidelines:
- Write your answers to the theory questions in clear and concise sentences.
- For the coding problems, write Python code that follows proper syntax and includes comments to explain the logic where necessary.
- Submit your homework as a Python script (.py file) along with your answers to the theory questions.
- Make sure your code is properly formatted and easy to read.

Note: Feel free to refer to your class notes, the lesson materials, or online resources to help you complete the homework. Good luck!
