## Lesson 6: Working with Strings in Python

Objective: 
Cover string manipulation, string methods, and formatting in Python.

### 1. Introduction to Strings
Strings are sequences of characters in Python. They are used to represent text and are a fundamental data type.

### 2. Creating Strings
Strings can be created using single quotes (''), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''') for multi-line strings.

Example:
```python
single_quoted = 'Hello, World!'
double_quoted = "Python Programming"
multi_line = '''
This is a multi-line string.
It can span across multiple lines.
'''
```

### 3. String Manipulation
- Concatenation: Combining two or more strings using the + operator.
- Repetition: Repeating a string using the * operator.

Example:
```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
greeting = "Hello, " + full_name

repeated_text = "Repeat " * 3  # Repeats "Repeat " three times
```

### 4. String Methods
Python provides various string methods for string manipulation:
- len(): Returns the length of a string.
- lower(): Converts a string to lowercase.
- upper(): Converts a string to uppercase.
- strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
- split(): Splits a string into a list of substrings.
- join(): Joins a list of strings into one string.
- find(): Searches for a substring and returns its index.
- replace(): Replaces a substring with another string.

Example: 
```python
text = "   Python Programming   "
length = len(text)
lower_text = text.lower()
upper_text = text.upper()
stripped_text = text.strip()
word_list = text.split()
new_text = " | ".join(word_list)
index = text.find("Programming")
replaced_text = text.replace("Python", "Java")
```

### 5. String Formatting
String formatting allows you to create strings with placeholders and fill them with values.

Example:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_text = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
pi = 3.14159
formatted_pi = f"Pi is approximately {pi:.2f}"  # Formatting with 2 decimal places
```

### 6. Additional Examples
Example 1: Counting Characters
```python
text = "Python is fun!"
count_e = text.count("e")
print("Number of 'e' characters:", count_e)
```

Example 2: Reversing a String
```python
text = "Python"
reversed_text = text[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_text)
```

Example 3: Checking for Substring
```python
email = "user@example.com"
if "@" in email and "." in email:
    print("Valid email address.")
else:
    print("Invalid email address.")
```

Example 4: Removing Whitespace
```python
input_text = "  This is some input text.  "
cleaned_text = input_text.strip()
print("Cleaned text:", cleaned_text)
```

### 7. Exercises
- Exercise 1: Create a program that takes a user's first name and last name as input and prints a personalized greeting.
- Exercise 2: Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
- Exercise 3: Format a message that displays the current date and time in a readable format.
- Exercise 4: Remove any leading and trailing spaces from a given string.

### 8. Conclusion
In this lesson, you've learned how to work with strings in Python, including string manipulation, string methods, and string formatting. Strings are essential for handling text data in various programming tasks.

Continue practicing with strings to become proficient in working with textual data in your Python programs.
