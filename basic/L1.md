## Lesson 1: Introduction to Programming with Python

Objective: 
In this beginner-friendly tutorial, we will introduce students to the exciting world of programming using the Python programming language. We'll cover basic Python syntax and demonstrate how to use print statements and simple input/output functions.

### 1. What is Programming?
Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. Computers are powerful, but they are dumb. They need step-by-step instructions to do anything, and that's where programming comes in.

### 2. Why Python?
Python is an excellent language for beginners because it has a simple and readable syntax. It's widely used in various fields like web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

### 3. Setting Up Python
Before we start coding, let's make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

### 4. Your First Python Program
Open a text editor (like Notepad on Windows or VSCode) and create a new file with a `.py` extension.

Let's write our first Python program:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

- Save the file and open your terminal (command prompt on Windows).
- Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python file.
- Type `python filename.py` and press Enter.

### 5. Comments in Python
Comments begin with a `#` symbol. They are for your reference and don't affect the program's execution.

### 6. User Input and Output
You can take input from users using the `input()` function:
```python
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", user_input)
```

Here, `input()` takes user input and stores it in the `user_input` variable. We then use `print()` to display a greeting.

### Python Code Examples:
Example 1: Greeting User
```python
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", user_input)
```

Example 2: Simple Calculator
```python
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Quotient:", quotient_result)
```

### 7. Exercises
- Exercise 1: Modify the "Hello, World!" program to print your own custom greeting message.
- Exercise 2: Write a program that asks the user for their age and prints a message telling them how many years they have until they turn 100 years old.
- Exercise 3: Create a simple calculator program that takes two numbers as input and allows the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

### 8. Conclusion
This is just the beginning of your programming journey with Python. You've learned about basic Python syntax, how to use print statements, and how to take user input without explicitly using variables and data types. As you continue your learning, you'll explore more complex concepts and build exciting applications.

Stay curious, practice coding, and you'll become a proficient Python programmer in no time!
