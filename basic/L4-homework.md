## Homework 4: Introduction to Conditional Statements in Python

### Objective: 
The primary objective of this assignment is to introduce students to conditional statements in Python, emphasizing decision-making through the use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

#### Problem 1: Basic Conditional Statements
1. Write a Python script that prompts the user to enter an integer. Use an `if` statement to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. Extend the script to include an `else` statement. Print an appropriate message if the number is not positive.

3. Implement an `elif` statement to check if the number is equal to 0. Print a specific message if the number is zero.

#### Problem 2: Advanced Decision-Making
4. Create a program that asks the user to input their age. Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to categorize their age into the following groups:
   - 0-12: Child
   - 13-19: Teenager
   - 20-59: Adult
   - 60 and above: Senior

5. Extend the program to check if the user is a teenager with the voting age (18 years old and above). If yes, print a message encouraging them to exercise their right to vote.

6. Write comments in your code to explain the purpose of each conditional statement and provide clarity on the decision-making process.

Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
