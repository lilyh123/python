## Lesson 7: Loops (for and while) in Python

Objective: 
Teach the use of for and while loops for repetitive tasks and iterations in Python.

### 1. Introduction to Loops
Loops are control structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data.

###  2. The "for" Loop
The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.

Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### 3. The "while" Loop
The "while" loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.

Example:
```python
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

### 4. Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements allow you to control the flow of loops.
- "break": Terminates the loop prematurely.
- "continue": Skips the current iteration and continues to the next one.

Example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("Even:", number)
    else:
        continue
```

### 5. Looping with Range
The "range()" function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used with "for" loops to specify a range of iterations.

Example:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### 6. Additional Examples
Example 1: Sum of Numbers
```python
total = 0

for num in range(1, 6):
    total += num

print("Sum of numbers:", total)
```

Example 2: Finding Prime Numbers
```python
prime_numbers = []

for num in range(2, 20):
    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    if is_prime:
        prime_numbers.append(num)

print("Prime numbers:", prime_numbers)
```

Example 3: Countdown
```python
countdown = 5

while countdown > 0:
    print("Countdown:", countdown)
    countdown -= 1
```

### 7. Exercises
- Exercise 1: Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number (e.g., 7 times table).
- Exercise 2: Create a program that calculates and prints the factorial of a given number.
- Exercise 3: Implement a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. Use a "while" loop until the correct number is guessed.

### 8. Conclusion
In this lesson, you've learned about "for" and "while" loops in Python, which are used for repetitive tasks and iterations. Loops are powerful tools for automating tasks and processing data efficiently.

Continue practicing with loops to become proficient in using them for various programming challenges.

#### Vocabulary Words and Definitions:
- Loop: A control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
- Iteration: Each execution of the loop's code block is called an iteration.
- Sequence: An ordered collection of elements, such as a list, tuple, string, or range.
- Loop Control Statements: Statements like "break" and "continue" that control the flow of loops.
- Range: A function that generates a sequence of numbers for use in loops.
