## Homework 1: Introduction to Programming with Python
### Objective: 
The primary goal of this assignment is to provide students with a foundational understanding of programming using Python. This assignment focuses on basic Python syntax, the usage of print statements, and simple input/output functions. Additionally, it incorporates relevant programming vocabulary to reinforce understanding.

#### Task 1: Python Basics and Vocabulary
1. Write a Python script that uses the `print()` function to display the phrase "Hello, _______!" where the blank is filled in with a variable containing your name.

2. Create a variable named score and assign it the value 0. Use the `print()` function to display the content of the variable.

3. Explain in a comment what the term "variable" means in programming and provide an example in your code.

#### Task 2: Input and Output Functions
4. Write a Python script that takes the user's age as input using the `input()` function and prints a message like "You are _______ years old," replacing the blank with the user's input.

5. Create a program that prompts the user to enter their favorite color using the `input()` function. Display a message using `print()` that incorporates their favorite color.

6. Define the term "input function" in programming within a comment in your code. Include an example demonstrating the usage of the `input()` function.
